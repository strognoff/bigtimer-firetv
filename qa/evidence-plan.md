# Demo / Evidence Plan (BigTimer MVP)

Goal: produce the required artifacts for issue #6 Demo.

## Artifacts to capture
1) **<= 3 clicks start**
- Recording: launch app → start 2-minute preset in <= 3 OK presses.

2) **Lock mode**
- Recording: enable lock → attempt reset via Right DPAD (should do nothing) → focus Reset and short press OK (no reset) → long press OK (resets).

3) **Styles**
- Screenshots (or short clip): Numbers, Pie, Bar.

4) **Drift note**
- Manual note: run 10-minute timer vs wall clock; record delta at finish.

## Suggested capture checklist
- [ ] Fire Stick device
- [ ] Fire TV device
- [ ] Recordings saved with timestamp
- [ ] Note any UX/focus glitches
